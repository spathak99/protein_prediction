#RNN for protein secondary structure prediction

A reccurent neural network for protein secondary structure prediction
built without use of any framework besides tensorflow's low level API (see tf.matmul,tf.add, etc).
Accuracy is currently at 81% and will be higher once the data is fed into
an LSTM
